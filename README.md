<h3> Project Name: EKS Cluster Setup with Jenkins, Load Balancer Controller, and Weather Microservice </h3>

**Overview:**

This repository contains scripts and configurations for setting up an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster integrated with Jenkins for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD), Load Balancer Controller (LBC) for managing load balancers, and a Weather Microservice.

**Components:**

    EKS Cluster Setup: Scripts and configurations for provisioning an EKS cluster on AWS.

    Jenkins Configuration: Instructions and configurations for integrating Jenkins with the EKS cluster for CI/CD pipelines.

    Load Balancer Controller (LBC): Configuration and setup for managing load balancers in the EKS cluster.

    Weather Microservice: Details and code for a microservice that provides weather information.

**Requirements:**

    AWS account with permissions to create EKS clusters, IAM roles, and other necessary resources.
    kubectl installed locally for managing the Kubernetes cluster.
    Jenkins server for CI/CD pipelines.
    Docker for building and deploying containerized applications.

**Usage:**

    EKS Cluster Setup:
        Run the provided scripts to create the EKS cluster on AWS.
        Configure kubectl to connect to the newly created cluster.

    Jenkins Configuration:
        Install necessary plugins on Jenkins for Kubernetes integration.
        Configure Jenkins credentials for authenticating with the EKS cluster.
        Create Jenkins pipelines for building and deploying applications to the EKS cluster.

    Load Balancer Controller (LBC):
        Deploy and configure the Load Balancer Controller to manage load balancers within the EKS cluster.
        Ensure proper configuration of Ingress resources for routing traffic to services.

    Weather Microservice:
        Build and deploy the Weather Microservice to the EKS cluster.
        Ensure proper networking and security configurations for accessing the microservice.
